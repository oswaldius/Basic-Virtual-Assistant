# Basic-Virtual-Assistant
A Basic Virtual Assistant using python
This programme runs a basic virtual assistant using python, it requires PyAudio and PySpeech. It also requires the insertion of an
App ID which can be obtained via the WolframAlpha website. However the programme will run without this ID but be totally dependant
upon wikipedia for reference material.
Once running there is a audio prompt for a spoken question, and a text prompt. It is best to wait for the text prompt to appear
before asking a question.
The operation is a bit slow in giving an answer, but there is also a text based reply offered.
This is only intended for amusement, and to offer a demonstration of working code that can be applied elsewhere or developed
for a future project.
